- More unit tests
- Document validation against fits documented in chapter 13 of FOCUS (2006)
- Reproduce example analyses (L1, L2, ...) in FOCUS (2006)
- Export cost function together with mkinfit object, in order to make MCMC runs
  with the same cost function possible
- Version numbers and timestamp in output
- Specify default range from 0 to 1 for formation fractions
- Calculate confidence intervals for predictions (DT50 and DT90)
- Fix the use of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors for fitting SFORB systems
